# Obsidian Accent Plugin

This plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) makes it easy to use some didactic symbols without a lot of keyboards by using commands associated with Microsoft Office-inspired hotkeys.

When a command is triggered the plugin takes a character right before the cursor and replaces it with an accented one if possible.

## Commands

- Insert acute (`ctrl` + ``backtick ` `` )
- Insert grave (`ctrl` + `apostrophe '`)
- Insert circumflex (`ctrl` + `shift` + `caret ^`)
- Insert umlaut (`ctrl` + `shift` + `colon :`)
- Insert tilde (`ctrl` + `shift` + `tilde ~`)

The following commands are not about didactics, but have been added for convenience. Note that there is no need to enter `?` or `!` first.

- Insert upside-down question mark (`ctrl` + `alt` + `shift` + `?`)
- Insert upside-down exclamation mark (`ctrl` + `alt` + `shift` + `!`)
