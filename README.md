# Obsidian Accent Plugin

I could not find a simple and intuitive plugin to use diacritical characters comfortably. So I created my own. The hotkeys are inspired by Microsoft Office.

## Commands

- Accent hotkeys: Insert acute (`ctrl` + ``backtick ` `` )
- Accent hotkeys: Insert grave (`ctrl` + `apostrophe '`)
- Accent hotkeys: Insert circumflex (`ctrl` + `shift` + `caret ^`)
- Accent hotkeys: Insert umlaut (`ctrl` + `shift` + `colon :`)
- Accent hotkeys: Insert tilde (`ctrl` + `shift` + `tilde ~`)
